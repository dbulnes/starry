# Starry - A tipbot for Stellar

## Description
Starry is a robot crazy about Stellar. Before coming to earth, Starry lived a solitary life on the moon. Though they had many hobbies - model building, playing piano, reading poetry - Starry longed for something which the gray and docile environs of the moon could not provide. Community!

While scanning our own internet from afar for a suitable community to join, Starry happened upon our own public Slack chat. Though they had come across many other communities on the internet - many of which both disturbed and intrigued them - no community other than our own talked so much about "going to the moon". It was with this hope of being able to share the moon with others that Starry descended from the heavens and resolved to make the Stellar community as vibrant and successful as possible. What better way to do so, they thought, than by facilitating easy and secure tipping of XLM between chat members!
